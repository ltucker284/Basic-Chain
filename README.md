This is the Senior Research project of Liz Tucker and Juan Matiz. 

We aim to build a voting system using Hyperledger Fabric (https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/fabric) which is a distributed ledger framework maintained by the Linux Foundation. The purpose of this project is to bring accountability, reliability, and more security to voting systems.
